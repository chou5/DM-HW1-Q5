q5-a.r is a program which can get the performance of calculating three different distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Lmax) by inputing different k. 
Also, in this program can get three different metrics between every user and every other user.

For q5-a.r, it should be run in RStudio.
Input: You should import u.data and name it u before you run the program which u.data is in the 100K Dataset folder.
Output: three different distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Lmax) which are in the three different output file and three different performance based on using different distance metrics by inputing different k.
